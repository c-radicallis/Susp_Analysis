# Mountain Bike Suspension Analysis

This repository contains tools and data for analyzing mountain bike suspension kinematics and dynamics. It is designed to work with arbitrary spring and damper curves, providing a flexible solution for evaluating suspension performance.


## Contents

### 1. **Python Code**
- **Suspension Analysis Scripts**: Python scripts for performing kinematic and dynamic analysis of mountain bike suspensions.
  - Calculate leverage ratios, axle paths, and other kinematic properties.
  - Analyze suspension behavior under dynamic conditions using custom spring and damper curves.
  - Input and visualize spring and damper properties for the analysis.

### 2. **Excel Sheets**
- **Suspension Data**: Pre-configured Excel sheets to:
  - Organize kinematic data extracted from SolidWorks.


### 3. **SolidWorks Drawings**
- **Mountain Bike Model**: SolidWorks files for:
  - Extracting kinematic data.
  - Simulating suspension movement and geometry.

## Usage
1. Extract kinematic data from the provided SolidWorks drawings.
2. Use the Excel sheets to organize the data and define spring and damper curves.
3. Run the Python scripts to analyze the suspension's performance.

## Requirements
- **Software**: Python (with required libraries), Microsoft Excel, SolidWorks.
- **Libraries**: Install Python dependencies listed in the scripts.
